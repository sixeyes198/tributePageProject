        <p>His younger brother, Bruce Irons, is a former competitor on the World Championship Tour of Surfing. During his childhood, Andy regularly lost to Bruce in contests, but that changed once he entered the World Championship Tour.During his professional career, <br><b>he won three world titles (2002, 2003, 2004)</b>,<br><b> three Quiksilver Pro France titles (2003, 2004, 2005)</b>,<br><b> two Rip Curl Pro Search titles (2006 and 2007)</b> <br>and <b>20 elite-tour victories</b>, <br>including <b>the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing four times from 2002 to 2006</b>.<br> On September 3, 2010, he won the Billabong Pro Teahupoo in Tahiti.<br>
            <b>In 2009, Irons withdrew from doing the full ASP World Tour season for personal reasons</b>, though he did participate in a few events. He requested a wildcard entry for the 2010 ASP World Tour season, which was granted by ASP President Wayne Bartholomew. As a result, Irons did not have to re-qualify in 2010 via the World Qualifying Series (WQS). Irons won the Billabong Pro Tahiti 2010.
            He was inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California, in 2008. The Governor of Hawaii declared February 13 forever "Andy Irons Day". He was the only surfer to have won a title at every venue on the ASP calendar.
            Billabong produced an Andy Irons line of board shorts.</p>

    <section class="Rivalry">
        <h1 id="one">Rivalry with Kelly Slater</h1>
        <p><b>Irons</b> had a much-publicized, and, according to him, overhyped, rivalry with fellow professional surfer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Slater" target="_blank">Kelly Slater</a>. In an interview, Irons said:<br>
            For me, just being affiliated with Kelly--to be next to him--I mean, that's awesome. He's the ultimate surfer. He's the best surfer in the world. Ever. Best competitive, best free surfer, you name it, and to have my name put next to his everywhere really is flattering. He's the Michael Jordan of our sport. Kelly knows how I feel about him. Despite all the media hype that comes out of a rivalry there's a lot of respect given both ways. People don't realize there are times when we hang out. We'll go check the waves together. We talk about boards. He invited me personally to his contest on Tavarua. There's a ton of respect there.<br>
            <b>Slater himself was quoted in a Surfer Magazine tribute for Irons:</b><br>
            Andy was an absolutely gifted individual. I’m lucky to have known him and had the times we had together. I feel blessed that we worked through the differences we had and I was able to learn what I’m made of because of Andy. I got to know a happy, funny, innocent kid who was happy to live every second with the people he loved. I’m so sad. My thoughts are with Bruce and Lyndie and their parents and all of his many friends around the world. It’s a huge and far too premature loss for all of us. He was the most intense competitor I’ve ever known and one of the most sensitive people. He had so much life left in him and it hurts to think about. We look forward to his memory living on with our memories of him and his child on the way. There are a lot of uncles awaiting his arrival. I really miss Andy. He had a really good heart.</p>
